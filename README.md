## Layout Idea

- Divided the content into three main parts: todolist, counter and navbar.
- Layout techniques: flex and positioning.
- Font style: The font-style of the design layout is replaced by the 'bitter' font-style(from google font).
- Image source: PNG files provided by the website and hand-drawn SVG files.
- Use CSS custom properties (variables) to manage frequently used colors.
- Import normalize.css: provides better cross-browser consistency in the default styling of HTML elements.
- Cross-browser: Considering that FireFox does not support the pseudo elements of input tag.
